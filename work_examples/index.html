	<h3>Longer Project Descriptions</h3>
	<p id="mirror">I built a "smart mirror" using a raspberry pi, 2-way mirror and a computer screen. The raspberry pi is open constantly to a webpage I created which systematically checks the weather and my calendar. These items are displayed on the screen along with the time, day, a custom greeting message and notifications about holidays and birthdays. In addition, the mirror uses an infrared camera and Microsoft Azure services to provdie favial recognition. When someone the device knows approches the mirror, it will recognize their face and bring up all personalized information. In my case, the mirror greets me with a "Hello Jacob!" and shows my calendar when it gets a positive read on my face. Future plans include integrating a LEAP motion controller to allow hand control of the mirror, as well as more intellegent calendar services. For example if it identifies an upcoming meeting in my calendar, I'd like to see an anticipated travel time so I canquickly see when to leave!</p>
	<p id="door">I made a device to open the door to a dorm room with a fingerprint scanner. An infrared proximity sensor wakes the device up when someone gets close enough and then if the fingerprint sensor detects a match, it turns a servo which opens the door handle. In order to get enough torque to open the door, I 3D printed a 3-tier compound pulley system which mounted to the door handle. This system made sure the door was still usable in its normal configuration (with no cool fingerprint scanner).</p>
	<p id="rocket">I designed custom gps tracking electronics to go inside a model rocket. In addition, I created a launch control panel webapp which gives total control of all the rocket electronic systems. The GPS collects data 20 times a second and transmits it to the computer. A websocket is opened from Node.js which can be accessed by the webapp for live updates of the rocket's geographical position, speed and alititude.</p>
	<p id="pictures">Using a laser cutter, I engraved images into long strips of mirrored acrylic. The light parts of the images I used where removed from the acryllic, so that only the dark parts remained mirror like while the rest was clear. I created LED backlight circuits and a custom frame for each image. In the dark with the backlights on, the mirrored images look nearly like 3-dimensional black and white portals.</p>
	<p id="arrow">While working as an Applications Engineering Intern at Arrow Electronics, I worked with a team to create a fully functional remote-monitoring IoT system. The device relayed real time environmental data from 6 nodes to a central user interface. In addition, it monitored the status of "industrial machinery" (a skittle sorting device). I worked primarly to design the IoT gateway. The gateway linked the nodes with the user interface. At periodic intervals (set by the user), the gateway requests data updates from each of the nodes. The incoming data is saved in a database on the gateway (for a user-set amount of time) before it is automatically deleted. Incoming data instantly pushes changes to the user interface. In addition to creating the database tables and designing the gateway to control all pipelines of incoming and outgoing data, I worked with a colleague to add Amazon Alexa integration to our system. People in the office can request the skittle sorting machine to dispense skittles, they can request the current temperature or even if people are currently moving around the office.</p>
	<p id="lasers"><em>Scientific Explanation</em>I had my first exposure to photonics research as a research assistant at ETH Zurich. I explored the nature of radiation pressure on a tuning fork. Using a modulated laser, I created three dimensional graphs of the transfer function and phase change of radiation-pressure-induced-oscillations on the crystal tuning fork. A few years later, I was given the oppurtunity to work in an optics lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. I worked with a grad student (David Miller) to try to understand super-resolution optical lithography. By placing silicon chips coated with photoresist at the recombination point of an interferometer, we were able to etch lines in the resist which were below the diffraction limit of the light we were using. I used a scanning electron microscope to observe and measure the resulting features. In addition, I made a graphical user interface to control the laser system nearly autonomously which just a few user inputs. <em>Normal English Explanation</em>While in High School, I had an internship at a University in Switzerland. I pointed a red laser at a small crystal tuning fork. When light strikes an object, it exerts a force called radiation pressure. Therefore by shining the laser at the turning fork, I could cause the fork to oscillate. However, I found that depending on where the light hit the tuning fork, it changed how it moved. I made a graph of the tuning fork and how strong the oscillations were from each part that the laser hit. While in college, I got another internship in an optics lab. I worked on a project where we were trying to engrave really tiny patterns onto a thin peice of silicon. The problem is that because of the wave-like properties of light, there is a limit to how small a pattern you can engrave in the silicon. Image trying to draw detailed patterns a jumbo chalk. At some point, there is a limit to how small you can go. This is called the diffraction limit. However, by using a clever trick, we were able to draw lines that were smaller than this limit. By splitting the laser into two identical beams and then bringing them back together right at the silicon chip, the wave-like properties of light now come to help out! The laser light "cancels" itself out at some regions leaving little parallel lines </p>
