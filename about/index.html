	<h2>Philosophy of Education</h2>
	<p>I believe that education in this country is often largely associated as a negative thing. Often times it is portrayed as a necesary evil if we want to someday be successful. And while this may still be true, I beleive education should be more of a joy than a chore. I believe it should be exciting! I believe education should be the unrestrained search to understand what we find interesting. But beyond that, it should be an exposure to that which we aren't even aware of. It should give us a glimpse of what else is out that that we can get excited and passionate about. Education shouldn't be the journey from now until world-wide-fame, it should be an adventure that opens us up to see all that there is in the world.</p>

			I am studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Astrophysics becuase they fascinate me. I've always loved learning about how things work, in fact my favorite book for years as a kid was a huge picture book called How Things Work. It showed the insides of many thigns around us and what moving parts accomplished various tasks. To me, electrical and computer engineering is just a real world extenstion of that book. Everyday I get to learn what components make computers function, how phones communicate and how lights work. It's an unending discovery into understanding things around me.

			 I added Astrophysics because it further excited me. I could read about black holes, quasars, or theories of quantum gravity for hours. It isn't a toil, its an exciting adventure! Its everything education should be to me.
